\n\n\n### Input:\nWrite a story on Robert Langdon's adventures in India.\n\n### Response:\n \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t Robert Langdon had no idea where he was or how long he had been unconscious when he opened his eyes and found himself staring up at the underside of a horse. Or rather the underside of a horse skull. The skull was mounted on a plaque above his head, and the plaque was mounted on a column, which was buried in the earth floor of a dusty, dimly lit room. \t\t\t\t\t He was lying on his back with his head near the floor, his neck craned upward, his body aligned perfectly beneath the horse skull. Propped on a pillow beside him, hovering over his face, was a pair of grotesque eyes. \t\t\t\t\t The eyes belonged to a tall, wrinkled Brahmin priest who was kneeling to examine his unconscious guest. The priest’s eyes were dark and dismissive, set in a wrinkled mask of indifference. They were probably the most unemotional eyes Langdon had ever seen. \t\t\t\t\t “You’re awake,” the priest said in perfect English. “Finally.” \t\t\t\t\t Langdon tried to sit up, but the priest gently forced him back down, saying, “Head trauma. You’ve been unconscious for nearly an hour.” Langdon fought to clear the fog from his mind. “What happened?” \t\t\t\t\t “You were knocked out.” “How?” \t\t\t\t\t “The traditional way.” The priest motioned to the bruise rising on Langdon’s forehead, and Langdon reached up to feel the bandage wrapped around his head. Then he spotted the handcuffs binding him to the pillar. \t\t\t\t\t You’re alive, he told himself. Relief flooded through him. After a long moment, Langdon managed to say, “Where am I?” \t\t\t\t\t “In the sacred inner chamber of Kali temple.” \t\t\t\t\t Langdon now saw that the stone wall behind the priest was open to the outside air, and he could see stars through a gap in the pillars. He was outside after all. Outside... in Kolkata. The familiarity of the words jolted his memory. Kali temple? Langdon now recalled the voice that had spoken to him through the FedEx box. “You are a guest in the palace of Kali.” Kali. The female principle of action. The destroyer. The transformative force. The goddess who clears away obstructions so the soul can move forward. Langdon now saw that the horse skull hovering over his face was Kali’s favorite headgear—the skull of a horse—its long teeth protruding like vicious tusks. The small, decorative room in which Langdon found himself was clearly a shrine to the Hindu goddess Kali, and the fact that they were in Kolkata should have made it obvious where they were. Calcutta was Kali’s city. Her kingdom. She was the patron goddess of the city’s red-light district, and her numerous temples there were known for their fierce, bloody rituals. Langdon now saw that this tiny room had been dug into the earth floor of the temple, and the walls and floor were simply bare earth. The only furniture was a mat on which the priest was kneeling, and a low bench against the back wall. The room smelled earthy and damp. \t\t\t\t\t “You are very famous in our country, Professor,” the priest said. “I am honored to meet you.” Langdon was confused. “You know who I am?” \t\t\t\t\t “Of course. I have seen you on television.” Langdon tried to imagine what kind of program would have him traveling to Kolkata to visit a Hindu goddess. The Temple Show? \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t “I’m sorry,” Langdon said. “I still don’t understand. What happened? Why am I here?” \t\t\t\t\t “You were knocked out.” \t\t\t\t\t “Yes, I heard that. But how?” \t\t\t\t\t “The traditional way.” The priest motioned to the bruise rising on Langdon’s forehead, and Langdon reached up to feel the bandage wrapped around his head. Then he spotted the handcuffs binding him to the pillar. \t\t\t\t\t You’re alive, he told himself. Relief flooded through him.
